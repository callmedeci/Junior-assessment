# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

You can deploy now or later. To deploy now, open a terminal window, then navigate to or create a root directory for your web app.

Sign in to Google
firebase login
Initiate your project
Run this command from your app's root directory:

firebase init
Specify your site in firebase.json
Add your site ID to the firebase.json configuration file. After you get set up, see the best practices for multi-site deployment.

{
"hosting": {
"site": "junior-dev-assessment",

    "public": "public",
    ...

}
}
When you're ready, deploy your web app
Put your static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS) in your app's deploy directory (the default is "public"). Then, run this command from your app's root directory:

firebase deploy --only hosting:junior-dev-assessment
